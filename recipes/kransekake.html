<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>
        Powdered sugar
    </li>
    <li>
        Almound flour
    </li>
    <li>
        Peppermint extract, optional
    </li>
    <li>
        Vanilla extract

    <li>
        Meringue powder

    <li>
        Crushed peppermint, optional

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make the dough by mixing your almond flour with your powdered sugar until the two are well combined. Then add flavorings and egg whites, and then stir until you can form dough.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you've made the dough, form it into a ball, place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Before you roll your dough, let the dough sit at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Divide the dough into fourths. Start with one-fourth of the dough, while re-covering the rest of the dough until you're ready to use it. Gently roll the dough into 1/2 inch ropes. Place your dough in each size ring, bringing the ends together and slightly pinching them to hold together. Bake dough at 375 degrees F for about 10 to 12 minutes just until the tops have a hint of golden brown.
    </li>
    <li>
        To make the royal icing, combine the meringue powder, powdered sugar, and water. The icing should take a few seconds before dripping off the spoon when you dip it into the icing and lift it out.
    </li>

        Once the cookie rings are cooled completely, stack and decorate the Kransekake. Start with the largest ring and work your way up to the smallest ring. Between each layer, pipe the royal icing in a squiggle pattern.
